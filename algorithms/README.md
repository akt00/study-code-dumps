# Description
  - Full scratch implementations of basic algorithms and data structures in C++.
  - Includes most algorithms from the book, "Introdctuion to Algorithm 3rd edition" from MIT press.
  - Implementaion prioritizes simplicity and does not support template, move semantics, thread safety, iterators, performance optimization etc... It serves for the study and educational purpose only.

# Requirements
  Requires C++17 or later. This library is written with C++ standard libraries with no external dependencies.
 
# Implemeted algorithms (planned)
  - container
  - dynamic programming
  - graph
  - greedy algortihm
  - hash table
  - sort
  - tree
  - utilility
    - seaquential search
    - binary search
